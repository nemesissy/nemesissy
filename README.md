Short description of my repos

1) Repo testing asm.org using straight JUNIT. No fluff, not extensions, this is the way we used to do it (you damn kids).
2) Repo testing asm.org using TestNG. This is the standard, so here you go.
3) Repo testing asm.org using GEB/SPOCK. Groovy based test architecture that (in my experience) handles Angular and React type apps the best.
4) Repo testing asm.org using Cypress.io. I said I would never learn JavaScript. Never say never folks. This is so cool.
5) Repo testing asm.org/api using TestNG and Rest Assured.
6) Repo testing asm.org/api using Cucumber and Rest Assured.
