Short description of my repos

1) Repo testing <TBD> using straight JUNIT. No fluff, not extensions, this is the way we used to do it (you damn kids). Integrated with Test Rail
2) Repo testing <TBD> using TestNG. This is the standard, so here you go. Integrated woth Test Rail
3) Repo testing <TBD> using GEB/SPOCK. Groovy based test architecture that (in my experience) handles Angular and React type apps the best. Integrated woth Test Rail
4) Repo testing <TBD> using TestNG and Rest Assured. Integrated woth Test Rail
